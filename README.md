# PrimeAdSCFT
AdSCFTPrimeSolver is a prime density calculation tool based on the AdS/CFT (Anti-de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory) model. Using spectral resonance methods and the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, it automatically optimizes frequencies and parameters to accurately compute prime density and predict the distribution of primes.
