# **PrimeAdSCFT**

**PrimeAdSCFT** is a tool based on the **AdS/CFT (Anti-de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory)** model for **prime density calculation**. It utilizes spectral resonance methods and the **non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function** to optimize the frequencies, amplitudes, and phases, thereby accurately calculating the prime density and predicting prime distributions.

## **Features**

- **Based on AdS/CFT Theory**: Leverages the duality between **AdS space** and **Conformal Field Theory** to provide theoretical support.
- **Frequency Resonance**: Utilizes the **non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function** to calculate prime density based on their resonance properties.
- **Automatic Optimization**: Automatically selects the optimal frequency combinations and fine-tunes amplitudes and phases to ensure high-precision fitting.
- **Wide Applicability**: Supports **maximum \( x = 2^{512} \)**, making it suitable for large-scale number theory research and cryptographic applications.

## **Features in Detail**

- **High Precision**: The tool can calculate prime densities with an error typically below \( 10^{-6} \).
- **Automatic Frequency Matching**: Automatically selects the best matching frequencies based on the **Î¶ zeros** for prime density fitting.
- **Spectral Kernel**: Stores the optimized frequency and parameter combinations, enabling reuse for further prime density calculations and predictions.
- **Scalability**: Supports extremely large values of \( x \), up to \( 2^{512} \), making it ideal for large number theory problems.
- **Physical Interpretability**: Based on the physical duality and geometric properties of AdS space, providing deep insights into prime number distributions.

## **Installation**
